Do you ever wanted to be the hero of a fantasy novel? Many people, including the authors of this manualscript did. They wanted to participate in a game where they are the heroes of the ancient tales in a world filled with monsters, magic and mystery. That's the reason why this book was born in the first place.

"There are already books for that!" - you could say. Yes, there are many. However, none of them are available for free while being freely extendable and up to the standards of the authors.
